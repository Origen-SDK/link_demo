This is an Origen application that is used to demonstrate Origen Link by executing some simple tests of an SoC mounted
on an NXP Freedom board.

The board used to run the Origen Link server in the demo is the [UDOO Neo](http://www.udoo.org/udoo-neo/)

The board used to host the device under test in the demo is the [NXP Freedom Development Platform for Kinetis K22 MCUs](http://www.nxp.com/products/software-and-tools/hardware-development-tools/freedom-development-boards/freescale-freedom-development-platform-for-kinetis-k22-mcus:FRDM-K22F?)

The reference manual for the device under test is [K22P121M120SF7RM.pdf](http://cache.nxp.com/files/microcontrollers/doc/ref_manual/K22P121M120SF7RM.pdf)
